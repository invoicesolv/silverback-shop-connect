# Silverback Treatment Snapback Images - ISSUE RESOLVED

ISSUE FOUND: The provided "snapback" image files were actually MP4 video files with .jpg extensions!
This is why images weren't loading in the browser.

Files have been renamed to correct extensions:
1. silverback-snapback-white-bg.mp4 - Main product video (was .jpg)
2. silverback-snapback-back-white-bg.mp4 - Back view video (was .jpg)
3. silverback-snapback-side-white-bg.mp4 - Side view video (was .jpg)
4. silverback-snapback-model-female.mp4 - Female model video (was .jpg)
5. silverback-snapback-model-male.mp4 - Male model video (was .jpg)

TEMPORARY SOLUTION: 
Using white-hoodie-front-new.jpg as placeholder image for snapback product in all components.

NEEDED: 
Actual JPEG/PNG image files of the snapback cap for proper product display.
Either extract frames from the MP4 files or provide proper image files.
