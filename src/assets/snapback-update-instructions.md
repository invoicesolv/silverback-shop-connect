# Snapback Image Update Instructions

## Images to Replace

You have provided 4 actual snapback cap images. Please save these images with the following names:

1. **Image 1 (Back view)** → `silverback-snapback-back.jpg`
2. **Image 2 (Side view with logo)** → `silverback-snapback-front.jpg`  
3. **Image 3 (Female model)** → `silverback-snapback-female-model.jpg`
4. **Image 4 (Male model)** → `silverback-snapback-male-model.jpg`

## Steps to Update:

1. Save the 4 images you provided to this `/src/assets/` folder with the names above
2. Update the imports in the code files to use the new images

## Files that need updating:

- `/src/pages/ProductDetail.tsx`
- `/src/pages/Products.tsx` 
- `/src/components/ProductGrid.tsx`
- `/src/data/alphaprintProducts.ts`

## Current Status:
- All files are currently using placeholder hoodie images
- The MP4 video files have been renamed to .mp4 extensions
- Product functionality is working with placeholders
- Ready to swap in real images once saved

The snapback product is fully functional - it just needs the real images!
